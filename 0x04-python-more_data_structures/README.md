0x04. Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary
Why Python Programming is Awesome
Python is an incredibly versatile and powerful programming language that has gained immense popularity due to its simplicity, readability, and extensive community support. This README aims to highlight some key aspects of Python programming that make it awesome.

Sets in Python
What are Sets and How to Use Them
In Python, a set is an unordered collection of unique elements. Sets are defined by curly braces {} and can be used for various purposes, such as eliminating duplicate values and performing set operations.

Common Set Methods and Usage
Some common set methods include add(), remove(), union(), intersection(), and more. These methods enable manipulation and operations on sets, providing flexibility in handling data.

Sets vs Lists
While both sets and lists are used to store collections of items, sets are ideal when uniqueness is crucial, and set operations (e.g., intersection, union) are required. Lists, on the other hand, allow duplicate elements and maintain order.

Iterating Over a Set
Iterating over a set can be done using a simple for loop. This allows you to access and process each element in the set sequentially.

Dictionaries in Python
What are Dictionaries and How to Use Them
A dictionary in Python is a collection of key-value pairs. It provides a convenient way to store and retrieve data using unique keys. Dictionaries are defined within curly braces, with each key-value pair separated by a colon.

When to Use Dictionaries vs Lists or Sets
Dictionaries are useful when data retrieval by a unique identifier (key) is essential. Unlike lists, dictionaries offer direct access to values based on keys, making them efficient for certain scenarios.

Key in a Dictionary
A key in a dictionary is a unique identifier associated with a value. Keys must be immutable (e.g., strings, numbers) and provide a way to access the corresponding value efficiently.

Iterating Over a Dictionary
Iteration over a dictionary involves looping through its keys, values, or key-value pairs. This can be achieved using a for loop, providing flexibility in data processing.

Lambda Functions and Functional Programming
What is a Lambda Function
A lambda function, also known as an anonymous function, is a concise way to create small, unnamed functions. Lambda functions are often used for short-lived operations.

Map, Reduce, and Filter Functions
These functions are part of Python's functional programming paradigm.

Map Function: Applies a given function to all items in an input list or other iterable.
Reduce Function: Performs a cumulative operation on the items of an iterable, reducing it to a single value.
Filter Function: Filters out elements from an iterable based on a specified condition.
These functions enhance code readability and promote a more functional programming style in Python.
