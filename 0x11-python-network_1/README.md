- How to manipulate data from an external service

## Projects

- `0-hbtn_status.py`:  fetches https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/status
- `requests_example.py`: Demonstrates fetching internet resources using the `requests` package.
- `json_example.py`: Demonstrates fetching JSON resources and manipulating the data.
- `http_methods.py`: Demonstrates making various HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, etc.).

## Usage

Each Python script in this directory is self-contained and can be run independently. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

To run a script, simply execute it using the Python interpreter. For example:

```bash
python urllib_example.py
