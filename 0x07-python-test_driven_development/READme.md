Why Tests are Important
Tests play a crucial role in ensuring the reliability and correctness of your code. They provide a way to verify that functions and modules work as intended, catch errors early in development, and prevent regressions when making changes. Tests act as a safety net, boosting confidence in your code and facilitating collaboration among developers.

Writing Docstrings for Tests
When writing tests, it's essential to include clear docstrings to explain the purpose of each test case. Docstrings should describe the expected behavior, input parameters, and any specific conditions for the test. Follow the guidelines below:

Describe Purpose: Briefly outline what the test is checking.

Input and Output: Clearly specify input parameters and expected output.

Preconditions: Document any conditions required for the test to be valid.

Writing Documentation for Each Module and Function
Effective documentation enhances the usability and maintainability of your code. Here's a simple guide:

Module-level Documentation
Provide a brief overview of the module's purpose and functionality. Include any important constants or variables defined in the module. Mention setup or configuration instructions if necessary.

Function-level Documentation
For each function, include:

A concise description of its purpose.

Documentation for parameters, return values, and exceptions raised.

Examples demonstrating how to use the function.

Basic Option Flags to Create Tests
When running tests, consider using the following basic option flags:

-v or --verbose: Provides more detailed output during test execution.

-k <expression>: Selects tests based on a substring match.

--failfast: Stops the test run on the first failure.

--coverage: Measures code coverage during test execution.

Finding Edge Cases
Identifying edge cases is crucial for comprehensive testing. Consider the following:

Boundary Values: Test lower and upper bounds of acceptable inputs.

Invalid Inputs: Check how the code handles invalid or unexpected inputs.

Edge of Valid Inputs: Examine behavior near the edge of valid inputs.
