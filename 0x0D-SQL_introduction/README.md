# SQL - Introduction

This repository contains files and resources for learning SQL, including basic concepts and commonly used commands. Below is a brief overview of the topics covered:

## What's a database?

A database is a structured collection of data organized for efficient retrieval and manipulation. It can be of various types, such as relational, NoSQL, hierarchical, etc.
## What's a relational database?

A relational database is a type of database that organizes data into tables (or relations) consisting of rows (or records) and columns (or attributes). It enforces relationships between these tables through keys.
## What does SQL stand for?

SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It is a standard programming language used for managing and manipulating relational databases.
## What's MySQL?

MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that uses SQL. It is widely used for web development and other applications requiring database functionality.
## How to create a database in MySQL?

To create a database in MySQL, you can use the CREATE DATABASE command followed by the desired database name.
## What does DDL and DML stand for?

DDL stands for Data Definition Language, which includes commands for defining and modifying the structure of database objects (e.g., tables, indexes).
DML stands for Data Manipulation Language, which includes commands for manipulating data within database objects (e.g., SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
## How to CREATE or ALTER a table?

To create a table in MySQL, you can use the CREATE TABLE command followed by the table name and column definitions.
To alter an existing table in MySQL, you can use the ALTER TABLE command to add, modify, or drop columns, indexes, or constraints.
## How to SELECT data from a table?

To retrieve data from a table in MySQL, you can use the SELECT statement followed by the columns you want to retrieve from the specified table.
## How to INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE data?

To insert data into a table in MySQL, you can use the INSERT INTO statement followed by the table name and values to be inserted.
To update data in a table in MySQL, you can use the UPDATE statement followed by the table name and set of values to be updated.
To delete data from a table in MySQL, you can use the DELETE FROM statement followed by the table name and optional conditions.
## What are subqueries?

Subqueries (or nested queries) in SQL are queries nested within another query. They can be used to retrieve data based on the results of another query.
## How to use MySQL functions?

MySQL provides a wide range of built-in functions that can be used for various purposes, such as mathematical calculations, string manipulation, date and time operations, etc.
