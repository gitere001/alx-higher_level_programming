Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples
Lists in Python
In Python, a list is a versatile and mutable data structure that allows you to store and manipulate a collection of items. You can create a list by enclosing items in square brackets and separating them with commas.

Usage of Lists
Lists are created by enclosing items in square brackets.

Strings vs. Lists
Strings and lists share some similarities as both are sequences, but there are key differences. A string is an immutable sequence of characters, while a list is a mutable sequence of any type.

Common List Methods
Python provides various built-in methods for lists, such as append, extend, insert, remove, pop, and more. These methods enable you to manipulate and modify lists efficiently.

Lists as Stacks and Queues
Lists can be used as stacks (Last In, First Out) and queues (First In, First Out) using methods like append and pop.

List Comprehensions
List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists. They offer a more readable and expressive syntax for generating lists.

Tuples in Python
A tuple is an immutable sequence similar to a list but enclosed in parentheses. Tuples are often used for heterogeneous data and situations where immutability is desired.

Tuples vs. Lists
Use lists when you need a mutable sequence, and tuples when you need an immutable sequence. Tuples are often used for fixed collections of items.

Sequence in Python
A sequence is a data type that represents an ordered set. Both strings and lists are examples of sequences.

Tuple Packing and Unpacking
Tuple packing involves combining multiple values into a single tuple, while tuple unpacking allows you to assign the values of a tuple to individual variables.

The del Statement
The del statement in Python is used to delete items from lists or variables from the namespace.
